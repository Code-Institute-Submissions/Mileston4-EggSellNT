### Project purpose: 

The purpose of the project is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.

The site allows users to search eggs, they can search by farm as well, and after login they can purchase the products.

The project has the following sections:

* Home page
Contains a background image.

* Shop page
Contains all the available eggs.

* Farm page
You can view the farms from where the eggs arrive.

* Contact
Contains our contact details and the names of our employees with pictures.

* Login / Register page
Login page with option to register if someone is not a member yet.

* Cart
After a product is added to the cart, the user can view the containt of the cart here.

### Design and colors:

#### Fonts:

I used Noto Sans, from Google Fonts

On fonts.google.com in the about section the description of the font is the following: When text is rendered by a computer, sometimes there will be characters in the text that can not be displayed, because no font that supports them is available to the computer. Noto helps to make the web more beautiful across platforms for all languages. Currently, Noto covers over 30 scripts, and will cover all of Unicode in the future. This is the Sans Latin, Greek and Cyrillic family. It has Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic styles and is hinted.

Sans-serif is used as the default backup font in case when Nunito Sans was not possible to load.
